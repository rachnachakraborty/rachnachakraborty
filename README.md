## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome
Iâ€™ve spent years turning complex business challenges into structured, scalable systemsâ€”across industries like telecom, retail, energy and media. Most projects started with a single, well-framed questionâ€”and grew into something transformative.

In 2010, I gravitated toward open source. I have contributed to [winkNLP](https://github.com/winkjs/wink-nlp), a fast, lightweight, developer-friendly NLP library. These days, I'm shaping [winkComposer](https://github.com/winkjs/wink-composer)â€”a streaming analytics framework for Node.js designed to turn continuous data into insights.

Feel free to explore, reflect, or contributeâ€”whatever path you choose, thanks for stopping by.
